# Introduction {#training-intro}

Fieldwork training is arguably one of the most important activities of any survey and has one of the most substantial impacts on data quality. It serves several purposes: 

1. __Build fieldworker capability__. In-depth content training, extensive practicing and capability-based selection ensure that fieldworkers are capable of implementing the survey as designed. This is key to limiting measurement error and nonresponse error, as well as coverage error and sampling error if the survey includes listing and in-field sampling.  

1. __Standardize fieldworker behavior__. Repeated practicing under supervision and continuous feedback streamline how fieldworkers implement the survey. Reducing idiosyncratic behavior is important to mitigate the very damaging fieldworker effects.

1. __Scrutinize methodology__. Particularly in surveys with limited pre-testing and piloting, often fieldwork training is effectively the most detailed review of the questionnaires, translations, CAPI and survey processes. Identifying and correcting mistakes is key to reducing specification error.

Unfortunately, in many surveys fieldwork training is not implemented effectively to produce fieldworkers that are fully capable of implementing the survey, or is inefficient by being too demanding on trainers, survey budget and timeline.

This guide gives recommendations on how to implement fieldwork training that effectively prepares field workers while not overburdening trainers or overstretching survey resources. It assumes fieldwork training to be in-person, as is custom for most socio-economic surveys with personal interviews.   

Chapter \@ref(training-tldr) [Key recommendations] provides a TL;DR summary of key recommendations that should be implemented in fieldworker training. It is targeted at at survey designers, managers, or anyone who would like to get a quick overview of what matters most.

Chapter \@ref(planning-and-preparation) [Planning and preparation] is targeted at survey designers, managers, fieldwork managers, trainers or any other role that is involved in the planning, budgeting and preparation of the fieldwork training. It provides recommendations on the training location, timing, size, the trainers, training content and schedules, and includes checklists of the key items to prepare prior to the training. 

Chapter \@ref(conducting-the-training) [Conducting the training](#conducting-the-training) gives useful recommendations on how an effective and efficient fieldwork training can be conducted. It provides extensive details and step-by-step guides for different training modules. It is mainly targeted towards trainers and is best read during training preparation and the training itself.

Chapter \@ref(assess-select) [Assess & select fieldworkers](#assess-select) describes how to implement a competitive skill-based fieldworker selection that is critical to achieve quality in surveys. The chapter is mainly targeted towards trainers and gives step-by-step guides on how to effectively implement written tests, systematically evaluate skills and select fieldworkers. Survey designers and managers may be interested in reading about the benefits of this approach that are summarized at the beginning of the chapter.
