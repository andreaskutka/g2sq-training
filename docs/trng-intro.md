# Introduction to training

Fieldwork training is arguably one of the most important activities of any survey and has one of the most substantial impacts on data quality. It serves several purposes: 

1. __Build fieldworker capability__. In-depth content training, extensive practicing and capability-based selection ensure that fieldworkers are capable of implementing the survey as designed. This is key to limiting [measurement error] and [nonresponse error], as well as [coverage error] and [sampling error] if the survey includes listing and in-field sampling.  

1. __Standardize fieldworker behavior__. Repeated practicing under supervision and continuous feedback streamline how fieldworkers implement the survey. Reducing idiosyncratic behavior is important to mitigate the very damaging [fieldworker effects](#impacterror).

1. __Scrutinize methodology__. Particularly in surveys with limited pre-testing and piloting, often fieldwork training is effectively the most detailed review of the questionnaires, translations, CAPI and survey processes. Identifying and correcting mistakes is key to reducing [specification error].

Unfortunately, in many surveys fieldwork training is not implemented effectively to produce fieldworkers that are fully capable of implementing the survey, or is inefficient by being too demanding on trainers, survey budget and timeline.

This part of the book gives recommendations on how to implement fieldwork training that effectively prepares field workers while not overburdening trainers or overstretching survey resources. It assumes fieldwork training to be in-person, as is custom for most socio-economic surveys with personal interviews.   

Chapter \@ref(planning-and-preparation) [Planning and preparation] is targeted at survey designers, managers, fieldwork managers, trainers or any other role that is involved in the planning, budgeting and preparation of the fieldwork training. It provides recommendations on the training location, timing, size, the trainers, training content and schedules, and includes checklists of the key items to prepare prior to the training. 

Chapter \@ref(conducting-the-training) [Conducting the training](#conducting-the-training) gives useful recommendations on how an effective and efficient fieldwork training can be conducted. It provides extensive details and step-by-step guides for different training modules. It is mainly targeted towards trainers and is best read during training preparation and the training itself.

Chapter \@ref(assess-select) [Assess & select fieldworkers](#assess-select) describes how to implement a competitive skill-based fieldworker selection that is critical to achieve quality in surveys. The chapter is mainly targeted towards trainers and gives step-by-step guides on how to effectively implement written tests, systematically evaluate skills and select fieldworkers. Survey designers and managers may be interested in reading about the benefits of this approach that are summarized at the beginning of the chapter.  
  
## Key recommendations{-}
Follow below key recommendations to ensure a successful fieldworker training. 

1. __Train an excess of at least 20% of fieldworkers.__ This allows for meaningful competency-based fieldworker selection at the end of the training and to have a reserve of fieldworkers. If working with unknown teams, mainly new recruits, or expected high attrition, increase the excess to 40% to ensure capable fieldworkers. 

1. __Assess trainees from the beginning__. Use frequent written tests throughout the training to evaluate their understanding of the survey content. Where expert measurements are required, use standardized tests to assess their skills and accuracy. Observe and rate key skills in a structured way.  

1. __Select fieldworkers based on capacity__. Select interviewers, supervisors and other fieldwork roles towards the end of the training, based on capacity demonstrated during the training. Be careful when considering other criteria such as previous survey experience, as this may not be the best indicator of capacity level for the given survey.      

1. __Don’t cut on duration!__ Allow at least 15 working days of fieldwork training for an LSMS-style survey with a questionnaire of 2-2.5 hours. Shorter training is normally not enough for the complex content of a socio-economic questionnaire to be learned and sufficiently practiced.

1. __Keep it small__. Try not to train more than 50 people at the same time. Learning outcomes quickly decrease with larger class sizes. If necessary, try to adjust the fieldwork plan such that fewer fieldworkers work over a longer period.  

1. __Sufficient and experienced trainers__. Delivering quality training is more than a full-time job. Make sure there are enough trainers and that they have solid survey, context and subject experience. Sending only a junior colleague without much experience to the field to be in charge of the training is not a good idea. 

1. __Be prepared__. Make sure questionnaires, translations, CAPI and manuals are truly ready prior to the start of training and have been thoroughly tested. Have the venue fully set up and all admin and logistics sorted before starting. The quality of training can suffer badly from insufficient preparation.   

1. __Less instructional & theoretical, more interactive & hands-on__. Avoid one-directional training methods where trainers give long presentations about theory and questionnaires. Instead, engage trainees as much as possible on actual training content. Train using the manual, demonstrations, videos, real-world examples, etc.  

1. __Practice, practice, practice__. Frequent practice is crucial for trainees to fully internalize the content and be able to apply it in the field. Do not leave (field) practice to the end. Practice in groups, front-of-class role-plays and with respondents on-site or in the field throughout the training.  

1. __Go beyond the questionnaire__.  Knowing the questionnaires alone does not make good interviewers. Trainees need to learn and practice a set of interviewing techniques such as correct probing or encouraging participation as well as pre- or post-interview tasks, such as respondent selection or responding to rejected interview files in CAPI.  

1. __Assess readiness for field__. At the end of the training, conduct a final field test that mimics field conditions and allows fieldworkers to be observed and evaluated before using the actual sample. If the team is not ready, extend the training by a few days to revisit and strengthen problematic areas. 

1. __Engage__. As a survey designer, do not sit back and leave the delivery of training to only the survey firm, fieldwork manager or trainers. Actively participate, check that content is correctly understood, explain what matters, etc. You have put a lot of effort into the design – make sure it is implemented correctly.
