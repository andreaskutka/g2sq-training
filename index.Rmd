## About this guide{-}

Undoubtedly, fieldwork training is one of the most crucial activities of any survey and significantly influences the quality of the collected data. However, in many surveys, it is not as effective as it could be, leading to suboptimal data quality. This guide provides actionable advice for successfully planning and delivering effective fieldwork training, which prepares field workers to collect high-quality data, without overburdening trainers or overstretching survey resources. 

This guide is a valuable resource for a diverse range of survey practitioners. Survey designers and funders can benefit from guidance on the resources necessary for successful fieldwork training. Meanwhile, survey and fieldwork managers, as well as trainers, will find practical tools and tips on how to plan, prepare, and implement fieldwork training that is both effective and efficient. Refer to below chapter summaries to find out which part will be most beneficial to you.

This guide is organized into 4 Chapters:

Chapter \@ref(training-essentials) [Essentials] outlines the main objectives that fieldworker training should aim to achieve and provides a summary of key recommendations on how to effectively achieve them. If you're short on time and need a quick overview, this chapter is for you! 

Chapter \@ref(planning-and-preparation) [Planning and preparation] is targeted at anyone involved in the planning and preparation of fieldwork training, from survey funders to survey or fieldwork managers and trainers. It covers important aspects such as training location, timing, size, trainers, content, and schedules, and provides checklists to ensure nothing is missed before the training.

Chapter \@ref(conducting-the-training) [Conducting the training](#conducting-the-training) is a valuable resource for trainers looking to conduct effective and efficient fieldwork training. It offers comprehensive details and step-by-step guides for different training modules. It is a highly recommended read for trainers while preparing for and conducting the training.

Chapter \@ref(assess-select) [Assess & select fieldworkers](#assess-select) explains how to implement a competitive, skill-based fieldworker selection process that is crucial for achieving high-quality surveys. It is primarily aimed at trainers and offers step-by-step guides on how to effectively implement written tests, systematically evaluate skills, and ultimately select fieldworkers. Survey designers and managers may be interested in reading about the benefits of this approach that are summarized at the beginning of the chapter.  

The recommendations in this guide should be considered as a helpful resource rather than a prescriptive solution. Although the methodology presented has proven effective in delivering successful fieldwork training, survey practitioners are encouraged to evaluate which improvements can be implemented given the context and constraints of their respective survey.

This guide is written with special reference to training for an LSMS-style surveys, i.e., in-person training for medium- to large-scale household surveys that cover a range of socioeconomic topics and implemented using CAPI (with specialized guidance on the Survey Solutions CAPI platform). However, most recommendations can be easily adapted to other survey types, modes, or software packages.  

This guidebook is the first in a series being developed by the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) team, with a focus on improving survey quality. For more information on LSMS and the guidebook series, please refer to [A LSMS Guidebook].
