## About LSMS  {-} 

The Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS), a survey program housed within the World Bank’s Development Data Group, provides technical assistance to national statistical offices in the design and implementation of multi-topic household surveys. Since its inception in the early 1980s, the LSMS program has worked with dozens of statistical offices around the world, generating high-quality data, developing innovative technologies and improved survey methodologies, and building technical capacity. The LSMS team also provides technical support across the World Bank in the design and implementation of household surveys and in the measurement and monitoring of poverty. 

## About this eBook series{-}

In the world of international development, surveys play a crucial role in informing official statistics, public policy design, and social research. There are flagship and long-standing survey programs such as the LSMS, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) that are widely recognized as methodologically sound and producing high-quality data. However, all too often there are other surveys that adopt suboptimal methods, leading to poor-quality data due to either a lack of capacity or scarcity of resources. Given that surveys are a crucial (and often the only) source of data on socioeconomic indicators available for decision making in the developing world, it is paramount that they are of the highest possible quality.

To address this issue, the LSMS team is developing a guidebook series aimed at steering survey practitioners away from bad practices and pointing them towards proven best practices that improve survey quality - even in a resource-constrained environment. The guidebook series will produce guides for all stages of the survey life cycle from inception, design, preparation, fieldwork training, fieldwork to post-fieldwork.

Each guide in the series will provide practical and actionable guidance to optimize survey quality, including available knowledge, best practices, and practical tips. The guidebooks draw from other existing guidelines, previous similar efforts, as well as insights from the academic survey methodology literature. Perhaps more importantly, they drawn from the extensive experience of internal and external survey experts in designing and implementing complex large-scale surveys, most notably LSMS surveys that serve as the backbone of welfare and poverty measurement throughout the developing world.

Survey methodology is constantly evolving with innovative approaches to data quality assurance continually being identified, particularly with advancement of technology. As such, guides part of this series are published as eBooks online, intended to be a living documents featuring new expansions and revisions on a semi-continuous basis.

## LSMS guidebooks {-}

This series and other LSMS guidebooks offer information on best practices related to survey design and implementation. While the Guidebooks differ in scope, length, and style, they share a common objective: to provide statistical agencies, researchers, and practitioners with rigorous yet practical guidance on a range of issues related to designing and fielding high-quality household surveys. The series draws on experience accumulated from decades of LSMS survey implementation, the expertise of LSMS staff and other survey experts, and new research using LSMS data and methodological validation studies.
